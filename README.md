## Overview
Redesigned a power distribution system for avionics equipment on a hybrid-powered rocket for 100k+ ft apogee mission. Utilized LiPo battery cells and switching voltage regulators to create a redundant fault-tolerant system for powering a variety of data-logging sensors and GPS transmitters.

Developed in Spring 2012 for USC's Rocket Propulsion Lab's "Traveler" rocket.

## Hardware
* Power requirements (max current, voltage, runtime)
* GPS, BigRedBee, Raven, Byonics, Arduino, camera, telemetry
